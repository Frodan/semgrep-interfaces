# semgrep-interfaces

This repository contains IDL (Interface Definition Language) files specifying
the interface between different Semgrep components (e.g., between
the semgrep CLI and the playground).

It also includes the schema for Semgrep rules, as both Semgrep and Semgrep App
rely on this.

This repository is meant to be used as a submodule.
